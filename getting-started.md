# Getting Started (Work in progress)

We think Github is awesome! The fact that you're reading this means that you probably do too :smiley:

But, like with all things, nobody knows everything about everything. And thats ok.

Our mission is to empower you with the latest insights and practical guidance on how to unlock the power of cyber resilience in your business.

And we think Github is a key enabler for that.

So regardless of whether you are a Github Master or a Github N00b, we want to empower everybody with the latest insights and practical guidance to unlock the power of cyber resilience in your business.

So lets get started...

## Step 1 - What is Github and how does Git work?

### Great resources

- Markdown: David Anson has published a great Github repo about the markdown lint and the rules around it. [Check it out here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/v0.23.1/doc/Rules.md#md041)
- What about emoji's? Rafael Xavier de Souza's repo has some great ideas around that. [Check out Rafael's repo here](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)

## Step 2 - Lets get your environment setup

There are a thousand and one ways in which you can set up your environment so you can not only learn more about Github but also start contributing to the Cybermana community.

The setup we've found works really well, particularly with the Microsoft cloud is:

1. Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) - This is a lightweight, integrated development environment (IDE) that is fast and very easy to use.
2. Github Desktop - Well we couldn't talk Github without playing with this one.
3. Visual Studio Extensions - This is one of the best bits about VSCode. There are literally thousands of opportunities here. So we'll walk you through some of them.

## Continue your Github journey

This **Getting Started** guide is intended to help you get started. Our biggest piece of advice would be to continue your Github journey so you can become a Github Master.

To help you on your way, we've pulled together some **Awesome Github** resources that will hopefully help:
