# Getting Started (Work in progress)

We think Github is awesome! The fact that you're reading this means that you probably do too :smiley:

But, like with all things, nobody knows everything about everything. And thats ok.

So regardless of whether you are a Github Master or just getting started, **our mission** is to empower you with the latest insights and practical guidance on how to unlock the power of cyber resilience in your business.

So lets get started...

## Step 1 - What is Github and how does Git work?

## Step 2 - Lets get your environment setup

There are a thousand and one ways in which you can set up your environment so you can not only learn more about Github but also start contributing to the Cybermana community.

The setup we've found works really well, particularly with the Microsoft cloud is:

1. Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) - This is a lightweight, integrated development environment (IDE) that is fast and very easy to use.
2. Github Desktop - Well we couldn't talk Github without playing with this one.
3. Visual Studio Extensions - This is one of the best bits about VSCode. There are literally thousands of opportunities here. So we'll walk you through some of them.
